A mock blog website made with the intention of learning authentication and using a database to store user content.

The website is held within the directory /blog-website and isn't currently served by the backend so to run it, you need to run a development server.

Backend uses hapi.js for the handling of requests. Mongoose for managing the database operations with MongoDB. JWTs were used for the authentication.

Frontend is a SPA which uses Vue. 

The website itself is not finished due to the fact that the scope of all the features would have required much more work than would have been worth in terms of learning. What is missing is the displaying of blogs in the frontend, a good home page and user profiles. Most of the backend is implemented however and the user authentication is implemented so the goals of the project were mostly fulfilled.
